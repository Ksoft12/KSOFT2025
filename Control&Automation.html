        <h2>Factory Acceptance Testing (FAT) Support</h2>
        <p>Factory Acceptance Testing (FAT) is conducted at the manufacturer's facility to verify that equipment or systems perform as expected before they are shipped to the customer site. FAT helps identify any issues early in the process, reducing the risk of costly modifications later on.</p>
        <h1>GOALS OF FAT:</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Verification: Ensure that the system meets all specified requirements and design criteria.</li>
          <li>Validation: Confirm that the system operates correctly in a controlled environment.</li>
          <li>Documentation: Provide a record of the system's performance and compliance with standards.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>How to Provide FAT Support</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Experienced Team: Ensure that the support team is knowledgeable about the equipment and testing procedures.</li>
          <li>Clear Communication: Maintain clear and open communication with the customer throughout the FAT process.</li>
          <li>Thorough Documentation: Keep detailed records of all testing procedures, results, and any issues encountered.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By providing comprehensive FAT support, you ensure that the systems you deliver are reliable, fully functional, and ready for deployment, which enhances customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.</p>
