        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            KSOFT Engineering Consultancy Services developed a PLC-based control system for two critical stages, Station A and Station B of a battery component testing line. The goal was to automate leak and electrical tests, manage seal slide actuation, and ensure part traceability through data tag reading/writing and barcode scanning all orchestrated through robust PLC logic.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our role focused on creating logic that coordinated conveyor positioning, barcode-based part validation, test sequence triggering, and integration of mechanical actuators such as vacuum/connector seal slides. No MES or robot logic was handled directly instead, the PLC acted as the central controller managing signals, test triggers, and sequence flow.

        <h2>Requirement</h2>
        <p>
            The automation requirement for Station A and Station B involved implementing sequential control logic through PLC to perform validation and testing of components placed on pallets. As a pallet entered Station A, the system read a data tag to identify the part. The PLC then advanced the pallet to a fixed location and triggered an automatic barcode scan. Upon successful verification, vacuum seal slides were actuated to secure the component, and a leak test was initiated. Once the test was complete, the slides were retracted, and the pallet was returned to its original position. The data tag was then updated with the test result, and the pallet was released from the station.
        </p>
        <p>
            At Station B, a similar sequence occurred with a focus on electrical testing. After reading the tag and scanning the barcode, the system advanced connector seal slides and triggered the electrical test automatically. Post-test, the PLC handled retraction, data tag writing, and pallet release. Throughout both stations, signal-based communication between the PLC and test equipment ensured precise coordination and reliable results.
        </p>
        <p>
            Operator involvement was minimal, as the entire sequence was handled autonomously. The system was also integrated with HMI screens that provided real-time status feedback, barcode scan results, test pass/fail indication, and fault messages in case of abnormal conditions.

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>
            KSOFT successfully delivered a complete PLC logic solution for Station A and Station B that automated all core functions: barcode validation, seal actuation, leak and electrical testing, and traceable data tag updates. The logic handled all necessary timing, signal interlocks, and conditional checks required to ensure a safe and accurate test environment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Both stations were capable of fully automatic operation with reliable performance. The system enabled efficient cycle times while minimizing manual handling and ensuring consistent traceability. Real-time HMI visualization empowered operators with immediate insight into process steps, reducing troubleshooting time and improving operational efficiency.
